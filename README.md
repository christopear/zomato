# Zomato

This script is no different than any of my other webscraping scripts. A script is provided for scraping the [Zomato directory](https://www.zomato.com/directory) to allow choosing which cities you would like to scrape.

In web scraping the cities, each restaurant is pulled down and put into a data.frame. Where there have been no reviews there is a score of zero (anomaly). They can then be plotted.
